/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "In this step you have to pull together the materials, software, ideas, ect... of things you will need inorder to start your project."

const design = 'For this step you want to create what you would like for your finished product to look like. This can be drawing it down on a piece of paper, and I also believe you can start writing your pseudocode down on this step.'

const implementation = "This is the step when you will actually start building and writing code to create the final product or/and project."

const testingAndIntergration = "This is when you will run your project on whatever device it is intended for and check for bugs and mistakes. This step is also where you will collect data from users of the product to get feedback of changes that may need to be made."

const maintain = "This step is just where you fix bugs and errors and make sure the over all project/product is runniong smoothley"
